# SMART DOC MANAGER by MSING WITH TRAUMA

Well hi there! This repository holds the code and script
for the SmartDocManager framework, for the HACKATHON contest. 

## Setup

If you've just downloaded the code, congratulations!!

To get it working, follow these steps:

**Download Composer dependencies**

Make sure you have [Composer installed](https://getcomposer.org/download/)
and then run:

```
composer install
```

You may alternatively need to run `php composer.phar install`, depending
on how you installed Composer.

**Configure the .env (or .env.local) File**

Open the `.env` file and make any adjustments you need - specifically
`DATABASE_URL`. Or, if you want, you can create a `.env.local` file
and *override* any configuration you need there (instead of changing
`.env` directly).

**Setup the Database**

Again, make sure `.env` is setup for your computer. Then, create
the database & tables!

```
php bin/console doctrine:database:create
php bin/console doctrine:migrations:migrate
php bin/console doctrine:fixtures:load
```

If you get an error that the database exists, that should
be ok. But if you have problems, completely drop the
database (`doctrine:database:drop --force`) and try again.

**Start the built-in web server**

You can use Nginx or Apache, but Symfony's local web server
works even better.

To install the Symfony local web server, follow
"Downloading the Symfony client" instructions found
here: https://symfony.com/download - you only need to do this
once on your system.

Then, to start the web server, open a terminal, move into the
project, and run:

```
symfony serve
```

(If this is your first time using this command, you may see an
error that you need to run `symfony server:ca:install` first).

Now check out the site at `https://localhost:8000`

Have fun!

**Optional: Webpack Encore Assets**

If you *do* want to build the Webpack Encore assets manually, you
totally can! Make sure you have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/lang/en/)
installed and then run:
```
yarn install
yarn encore dev --watch
```

## Thanks!
